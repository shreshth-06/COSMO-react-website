            "COSMO" - is the foremost source of cosmic explorations and
            astronomy news, chronicling (and celebrating) humanity's ongoing
            expansion across the final frontier. We transport our visitors
            across the solar system and beyond through accessible, comprehensive
            coverage of the latest news and discoveries. For us, exploring
            cosmos is as much about the journey as it is the destination. So
            from skywatching guides and stunning photos of the night sky to
            rocket launches and breaking news of robotic probes visiting other
            planets, at "COSMOS" you'll find something amazing every day.
